As the project goes live, a webpage will be opened and the user is given a choice to select either the Real-Time Detection or to upload the leaf image. On choosing the Real-Time Detection a camera pop-up will appear and it can be used to detect the leaves. Once detected, it scans for any disease and gives the output as whether it is a healthy leaf or a diseased one. The name of the disease is also mentioned along with the confidence percentage.
